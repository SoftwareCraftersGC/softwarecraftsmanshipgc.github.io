                <p>There is no agenda and there are no speakers before the event starts. Proposals are presented during the event itself in the mornings, and voted by the participants right after. It’s a great opportunity to speak to and code with many like-minded and talented developers in an incredible venue by the beach.</p>

                <div class="caption">It's about Action</div>
                <p>The retreat itself is free. The only thing you pay for is the hotel, meals and meeting rooms. We will be there for 48 hours to collaborate and share ideas. There will be hands-on coding sessions, sessions focused on discussion, interactive talks and lots more.</p>

                <p>We will not only spend the days together but also the nights. And – believe it or not – programmers are a great company! There will be lots of opportunities to spend your time. Starting with simple chilling over hiking and biking, playing games, hanging around, talking, laughing…</p>

				<p class="details">If you plan on arriving to the hotel before Socrates, the rooms are actually blocked from the 3rd until the 9th April so you are safe :). However if you are coming with some family members that won't attend the conference for vacation before or after, you should arrange it with the hotel directly once the rooms become available.</p>

				<p>
					The event itself is free, the attendees just have to pay their stay expenses, the conference space and the food. However, those come at no cheap price. Should you offer us your financial support, it would make a difference and <b>help Socracan to be open to everyone</b>, not just those that can afford it.
				</p>
				<p>
					In exchange for your backup, we can offer the following:
					<ul>
						<li>
							A mention during the opening and closing sessions of the conference
						</li>
						<li>
							Your logo on our website
						</li>
						<li>
							Mentions on social media channels
						</li>
						<li>
							The merchandise you may provide available to everyone at the conference
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					If you would like to discuss further details or alternatives as part of your sponsorship, please let us know. We will be happy to work with you to come up with something that benefits everyone.
